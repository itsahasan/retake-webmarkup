                <h2>Cloud gaming is a process of playing video games</h2>
            <p>
                Cloud gaming is a process of playing video games in data centers using remote servers. There’s no requirement to download and install games on a console or a PC. Instead, streaming service providers require a stable and smooth internet connection to send gaming information to a browser or an app installed on the recipient's device. The game is mostly played on the remote server, but one can communicate and watch with everything available locally on their device.

Cloud gaming mostly needs a subscription paid on a monthly basis or yearly basis to have a way into the content. The reality is that until now, streaming technology just was not up to the mark. But now due to faster internet speed, more access to more groups of people, and good hardware to deliver high-quality content. It’s really like the perfect wave of features building up to cloud gaming finally getting the perfect treatment it deserves.

According to Ken Research Analysis, the Global Cloud Gaming Market is expected to witness exponential growth of around 60% CAGR over the next six years (2022-2028) and cross ~US$ 20 Bn revenue by 2028.

According to GSMA 2019, there were 5.2 billion smartphone connections globally and by 2025 smartphone usage is expected to reach around 80%. Due to this gaming developers are developing more mobile-based games. So that they can earn more revenue from people adopting the usage of smartphones.

Poor internet connectivity within some countries acts as a major barrier for the cloud gaming market as it requires high-speed internet with proper bandwidth and setting up such a connection might be expensive. So lag in gaming or proper responsiveness of the game while playing might be an issue.

The pandemic of COVID-19 has substantially accelerated the use of cloud gaming devices and services as due to lockdown restrictions people were mostly locked in their places and cloud gaming did not require any additional hardware and can be played almost on any device turning it into their pass times during lockdown.

Scope of the Report

The Global Cloud Market is segmented by Offering, Device Type, Solution, End User and Geography. In addition, the report also covers the market size for each of the four regions of the Global Cloud gaming markets. The revenue used to size and forecast the market for each segment is US$ billion.
